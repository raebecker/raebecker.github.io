        <h2>Background Info</h2>
        
           <p>I completed the Graphic Design program at Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC) and earned an AAS in 2013. Then, after a year of saving money, I transferred to Eastern Washington University (EWU) to finish my BA.  I am currently a student at EWU steadily working towards my goal. Aside from school, I keep myself busy with a variety of different interest. I coach gymnastics at Dynamic Athletic Center, I am a freelance photographer, and my sister and I have started our own business called Salvaged Serendipity. </p>
           <p>My career at Dynamic began back in 2008 and I have continued to work there ever since. I love coaching and I love the kids. Everyday is something new. I also began taking pictures around the same time. In high school, I took a digital media class and fell in love with photography. It was actually that teacher that told me about the design program at SFCC. I have taken pictures of many high school seniors, families, newly engaged couples, and weddings. My newest adventure is the sign making business. I figured I wasn’t busy enough so I needed to add one more thing. It's something I’ve been doing for a while and it fits well with design. My sister is currently perfecting the woodworking while I focus on the design side. </p>

           <h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
           <p>I hope to continue learning new elements of design and to broaden my knowledge of web design. I believe it is important to stay up to date on new technologies and to always be learning new things. I usually look for the fasted and most efficient way to do something which I think is vital in the fast-paced design world. My computer skills are top notch but one of my goals has always been to become better at hand lettering and drawing. I think being able to take things way from the digital screen and back to pen and paper is very important. </p>
