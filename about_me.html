          <h1>Background Info</h1>
           <p>I completed the Graphic Design program at Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC) in earing an AAS in 2013. Then, after a year of saving money I transferred to EWU to finish school and get my BA.  I am currently a student at EWU steadily working towards my goal. I Aside from school I keep myself busy with a variety of different things. I coach gymnastics at Dynamic Athletic Center , I am a freelance photographer, and my sister and I have started our own business called Salvaged Serendipity. We take salvaged wood and turn it into something new. </p>
           <p>My career at Dynamic began back in 2008 and I have continued to work there ever since. I love coaching and I love the kids. Everyday is something new. I also began taking pictures around the same time. In high school I took a digital media class and fell in love with photography. It was actually that teacher that told me about the design program at SFCC. I have taken pictures of many seniors, family, newly engaged couples, and weddings. As far as the sign making business, that is my newest adventure. I figured I wasn’t busy enough so I needed to add one more thing. It something I’ve been doing for a while and it actually fits right in with design. As things were getting busier I enlisted my sister to help with the actually woodworking. That way I could spend more time designing and painting. It’s been pretty busy so far and I can’t wait to see where it goes! </p>

           <h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
           <p>I hope to continue learning new elements of design and to broaden my knowledge of web design. I believe it is important to stay up to date on new technologies and to always be learning new things. I usually look for the fasted and most efficient way to do something which I think is vital in the a fast paced design world. I would love to become better at things on paper. I can work pretty well with the computer but my one of my goals has always been to become better at hand lettering and drawing. I think being able to take things way fro the digital screen and back to pen and paper is sometimes very important. </p>
